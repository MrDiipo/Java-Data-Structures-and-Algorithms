Algorithms.Recursion is a way of solving aa problem by having a function calling itself.

Algorithms.Recursion properties
1) Performing the same operation multiple times with different input.
2) In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
3) Base condition is needed to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur.
